Please install the NVIDIA toolkit in order for the CuPY library to run utilize an NVIDIA GPU
Worst case scenario, If you don't want to install CuPy, use the numpy library instead of the cupy. 
After changing the library, the time complexity will increase drastically

Time complexity heavily depends on the hardware and number of CUDA cores in the GPU. 
WARNING! I will not bear any responsibility of any Burned GPU 
This project was tested and ran on 2x RTX 3090 with grandtotal 20,992 of CUDA Cores.
Please run from MainProgram.py. If the program fails, keep retrying. Sometimes it random to "no-path" graph

Library used:
NVIDIA CUDA toolkit
NetworkX
matplotlib.pyplot
CuPy (Works in conjuction with CUDA Toolkit)
Numpy
